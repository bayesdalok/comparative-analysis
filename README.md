# Comparative Statistical Analysis of STEM and Non-STEM Students

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents a **comparative statistical analysis** of students pursuing **STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)** and **Non-STEM** disciplines. Conducted as part of the **Final Year B.Sc. Statistics (2024â€“25)** curriculum at *The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda*, it investigates the **motivations, academic performance, study patterns, co-curricular engagement, skills, and career aspirations** of students across both streams.

The project also includes a **SWOT analysis** of STEM vs Non-STEM fields, providing a holistic perspective on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats shaping these academic choices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. **Motivations** â€“ Identify the reasons behind choosing STEM or Non-STEM courses (e.g., passion, career prospects, family influence, financial stability).
2. **Academic Performance & Study Patterns** â€“ Compare performance levels, study hours, and use of learning resources across streams.
3. **SWOT Analysis** â€“ Highlight the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats faced by STEM and Non-STEM students in todayâ€™s educational and career landscape.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Methodology

* **Sample Size:** 270 students

  * STEM: 72
  * Non-STEM: 198
  * Gender: 49.26% Female, 50.74% Male
* **Data Collection:** Structured questionnaire (22 questions) covering demographics, study patterns, motivations, co-curriculars, and career goals.
* **Sampling Method:** Stratified random sampling across faculties (Science, Technology, Arts, and Commerce).
* **Statistical Techniques Used:**

  * Chi-Square Test of Independence
  * Standardized Pearson Residuals
  * Goodman-Kruskal Gamma
  * Odds Ratio (OR)
  * Proportion Tests
  * Cramerâ€™s V for association strength

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

* **Gender & Stream Choice:** Significant association; females more likely to choose Non-STEM, males more likely to choose STEM.
* **Motivations:**

  * STEM students â†’ Passion/Interest + Career Opportunities (intrinsic drivers).
  * Non-STEM students â†’ Financial Stability + Family Influence (extrinsic drivers).
* **Academic Performance:** No significant difference between STEM and Non-STEM performances.
* **Study Hours vs Performance:** Negligible correlation (Gamma â‰ˆ -0.019).
* **Learning Resources:** Both groups use similar resources; however, STEM students seek professors/peersâ€™ guidance more often.
* **Skills Valued:**

  * STEM â†’ Technical & Problem-Solving skills.
  * Non-STEM â†’ Communication & Creativity.
* **Career Aspirations:**

  * STEM â†’ More inclined toward Research/Academia.
  * Non-STEM â†’ Industry, Entrepreneurship, and Arts-related fields.
* **Economic Background:** No significant association with stream choice.
* **SWOT Analysis:**

  * **STEM Strengths:** High employability, innovation potential.
  * **Non-STEM Strengths:** Creativity, flexibility, diverse career paths.
  * **STEM Threats:** Rapid skill obsolescence due to tech changes.
  * **Non-STEM Threats:** Market saturation, limited job security in some domains.
